# Project 2: Implementations and upgrades.

## ðŸ’¼ Project title: 
## Documentation about implementation and upgrades.

## ðŸ“‚ Context
The documentation usually starts with:

- Purpose of the implementation
- Issues that implementation will fix
- The test required before beginning the implementation
- Implementation process
- Post-implementation test

That was a huge help when sometimes something went wrong, and we had to revert the implementation.

Additionally, I get involved in changes that clients request based on specific needs; some examples I remember are:

- Close queues at a specific time. 
- Modify call flows
- Remove limit calls on the queue
- Functionally test

I meticulously documented those cases, providing step-by-step instructions, examples, and screen captures. Making emphasis on the details that helped my colleagues avoid mistakes.

# ðŸ‘¥ Target audience
The target audience of the second project was my colleagues and the new members, and I tried to motivate them to be involved so they could better understand the technologies we were using. 
I habitually asked them if they believed the documents were clear or if it generated confusion when they tried to follow. 
Similarly, my superiors shared their perspectives with me. The idea was always to improve and find ways to have the information as precise and organized as possible.
