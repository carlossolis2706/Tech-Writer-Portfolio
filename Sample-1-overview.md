# Project 1:  Knowledge base organization
## 💼 Project title
## Knowledge base organization scheme.
## 📂 Context
My first project was to organize the information already being managed within the team. My idea was to structure the organization based on the technologies we were using, such as Cisco, Verint, Upstream, eGain, and more.

I focused on breaking it into the essential components, starting with:

- Technology versions. 
- Integrations performed. 
- Functionalities.
- Step-by-step troubleshooting.

Over time, it was noticed that some scenarios were recurring with clients, such as:

- Add or move agents to other teams. 
- Clear browser cache. 
- Understand the meaning of specific fields in custom reports.

There were more, so I added more components to our knowledge base, such as troubleshooting articles for our clients.
My colleagues and I began adding more articles based on their client experiences, which immensely helped me build close relationships with many clients. 

## 👥 Target audience
The target audience of this knowledge base organization document were current team members, future team members, and clients, always trying to keep it simple with explanations so they could understand what I was trying to transmit. 
It was the onboarding guide for continuously adding helpful information for existing business services.
