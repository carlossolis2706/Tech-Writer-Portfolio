# Sample 3: SaaS Documentation

## ðŸ’¼ Project title
SaaS knowledge base

## ðŸ“‚ Context
With the addition of the SaaS environment, I proposed to divide the knowledge bases into two branches: 

- Unified Technologies (Cisco, Verint, Upstream, eGain, and more)
- Saas environment, based on our vendor, Thrio.

In the beginning, I started to create documentation about the difference between both environments to help my colleagues better understand the cloud technology and our role in it. One of my first contributions was:

- Purpose of staging environment
- Alerts severities
- WebRTC functionality

The opportunity to collaborate closely with our engineering department during implementations addressed to fix emerging issues. I documented valuable information such as:

- CallFlow creation
- IVR's management
- Callback systems

All this effort helped my team and me to adapt quickly and continue providing excellent client support. One of the last contributions that I remember the most was troubleshooting guides for our clients, where I explained in detail topics such as :

- Browser log extraction
- How to avoid browser bugs
- How to avoid high memory consumption

## ðŸ‘¥ Target audience
My target audience was my team, helping them acquire more knowledge about cloud technology, specifically the SaaS environment, and our customers, with detailed troubleshooting guides that helped them maintain productivity.
